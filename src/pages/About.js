          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to our Health Blog! We started this journey to share
            practical wellness tips, fitness routines, and mental health advice
            that truly make a difference. Our goal is to inspire you to live a
            healthier, happier life with small but powerful lifestyle changes.
          </p>

          <h2>ðŸŒ± How It Started</h2>
          <p>
            Our journey began when we realized how confusing and overwhelming
            the internet can be when it comes to health advice. With so many fad
            diets, workout myths, and misleading tips out there, we wanted to
            build a space thatâ€™s simple, trustworthy, and practical.
          </p>

          <h2>ðŸ’ª What We Believe</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Health is not about perfection, itâ€™s about balance.</li>
            <li>Small, consistent changes create the biggest results.</li>
            <li>Mental health is just as important as physical health.</li>
            <li>
              Everyone deserves access to simple, practical wellness advice.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>ðŸš€ Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            We aim to empower people with the right knowledge about nutrition,
            yoga, workouts, and mental well-being. Our blog posts, guides, and
            programs are designed to be beginner-friendly and easy to follow.
          </p>
